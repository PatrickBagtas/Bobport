                            While poor with business management and cursed with an unlucky streak, his experience and
                            skill in homemade cuisine has helped his restaurant stay afloat, in spite of seemingly
                            constant financial uncertainty, providing for his family all the while. He‘s voiced by H.

                    <p>Bob was born in 1967 to an unnamed mother and Big Bob. His father had a drinking problem and
                        ran a restaurant called Big Bob's Diner. Sometime in Bob's childhood, his mother passed
                        away.</p>
                    <p>As a child, Bob was forced to work in his father's restaurant and would rarely have time for
                        himself. His father never smiled as he grew. Bob made himself "toys" out of restaurant
                        supplies, such as a spatula, a scrubbing pad, and a piece of soap. He became attached to
                        these, but was rarely allowed to play with them either. He envied children that were allowed
                        to have fun ("Bob Fires the Kids").</p>
                    <p>At 14 years of age in 1984, Bob manned the grill while his father got his prostate checked.
                        He makes a special burger for his father's customers. Though when they are about to eat it,
                        his father returns home and becomes angry, tossing it out ("Father of the Bob").</p>
                    <p>Until Bob's 24th Christmas that was in 1994, Bob continued to work for his father. As a
                        gift, Bob Sr. changed the name of his restaurant to "Bob and Son's." Bob refuses this, to
                        his father's surprise, and says that it is impossible to work for him. Bob Sr. kicks his son
                        out for embarrassing him ("Father of the Bob").</p>
                    <p>He first met Linda in a bar after she accidentally hit him in the face with her engagement
                        ring from her then-fiancé, Hugo, getting it stuck in his mustache.</p>
                    <p>On Septemberr 3,[1] 1998 Bob and Linda got married at city hall. On their wedding night,
                        they worked because they couldn't afford not to ("Human Flesh"). They went on to have three
                        children: Tina, Gene, and Louise Belcher.</p>
